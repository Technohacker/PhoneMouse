# PhoneMouse
An Android app/Java Server combination that acts as an actual mouse
## How to run
This repository contains an Eclipse project for the server and an Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA project for the Android app.
Server: Open the project in Eclipse to run.
Client App: Open the project in Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA, edit NetworkTask.java and enter your computer's IP address, build and install on a device.
## How to use
There are two buttons in the app corresponding to the Left and Right mouse buttons. To scroll, swipe with two fingers (swipe down to scroll up and vice versa) and to move the cursor, tilt the device.
## TODO
+ This project's currently inefficient. It'll need a LOT of optimization.
+ Host IP is currently hard-coded into the code.
